I have these CSV related files and I want to build a knowledge graph with all the relations between them. Could you make the graph and the corresponding mappings in RML? Make sure you reflect ALL de relations between them EXPLICITLY.
country_es.csv

BO,"Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia"

country_en.csv
Code,Name
BO,"Bolivia, Plurinational State of"
