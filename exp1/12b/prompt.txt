I have these CSV related files and I want to build a knowledge graph with all the relations between them. Could you make the graph and the corresponding mappings in RML? Make sure you reflect ALL de relations between them EXPLICITLY.
persons.csv
fname,lname,amount
Bob,Smith,30
Sue,Jones,20
Bob,Smith,30
lives.csv
fname,lname,city
Bob,Smith,London
Sue,Jones,Madrid
Bob,Smith,London
